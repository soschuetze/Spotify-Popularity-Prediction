# Spotify-Popularity-Prediction
CS 305 Final Project

Explored machine learning algorithms to best predict popularity of songs of the top Spotify artists as well as predicting which artist belongs to a song based on the song's features. Machine learning models include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest-neighbors, SVMs, and neural networks. For predicting the artist, the neural networks had the highest accuracy (0.89), an F1-score of 0.79, a precision score of 0.74, and a recall of 0.75. For predicting the popularity score, the decision tree had the lowest RMSE of 4.2.
